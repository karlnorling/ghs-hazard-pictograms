# @ghs-hazard-pictograms/assets

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- Include package.json in the published files list for all packages.

  Explicitly listing package.json in the `files` field ensures the manifest is always present in the npm tarball, which is required for package resolution, exports map evaluation, and tooling that reads package metadata directly from the installed package directory.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Add repository, homepage, bugs, and license fields to all package manifests.

  Each package now declares:
  - `homepage` pointing to the GitHub Pages documentation site at karlnorling.github.io/ghs-hazard-pictograms
  - `repository` with the GitHub URL and the per-package `directory` path for monorepo tooling
  - `bugs` linking to the GitHub issues tracker
  - `license` set to MIT

  README files updated with a Links section covering docs, source, and issues.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Add npm keywords and include README.md in published files for all packages.

  Keywords cover GHS hazard pictogram terminology, chemical safety standards, transport/UN/ADR classifications, and package-specific terms (react, css, svg, sprite, etc.) to improve discoverability on npmjs.org.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add per-package README files targeted at npmjs.org documentation.

  Each package now ships a README with installation instructions, quick-start examples, full API reference, and links to sibling packages.

## 1.0.0

  Typed registry and lookup helpers for all GHS hazard pictograms.
  - `getAllPictograms()` — returns all 27 pictograms (9 GHS + 18 transport)
  - `getGHSPictograms()` — returns the 9 core GHS chemical pictograms (GHS01–GHS09)
  - `getPictogram(id)` — fetch a single pictogram by slug (e.g. `"ghs01-explosive"`)
  - `getPictogramsByCategory(category)` — filter by `physical_hazards`, `health_hazards`, `environmental_hazards`, `transport`, etc.
  - Full `Pictogram` type with inline SVG string, Wikipedia description, and asset paths for PNG/JPG/WebP at five sizes (240, 512, 768, 1024, 2048 px)

  ## @ghs-hazard-pictograms/react

  Ready-to-use React components for every GHS and transport pictogram.
  - One named component per pictogram (e.g. `Ghs01Explosive`, `Ghs06Toxic`)
  - Renders an accessible `<span>` with the SVG injected via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  - Props: `width`, `height`, `title`, `description`, `className`, `style`, `aria-label`
  - Zero runtime dependencies beyond React ≥ 18

  ## @ghs-hazard-pictograms/css

  CSS sprite sheet and JavaScript helpers for background-image–based display.
  - `sprite.css` — 27 short, valid CSS class selectors (`.ghs-ghs01`–`.ghs-ghs09`, `.ghs-adr-*`, `.ghs-un-*`) using `background-image: url(…)` with `background-size: contain`
  - `getCssClassName(id)` — resolves a pictogram slug to its CSS class name
  - `pictogramCssClasses` — map of all slug → class name entries
  - Validated with stylelint (`stylelint-config-standard`)
